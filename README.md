# Requirement Analysis in Software Development.

# What is Requirement Analysis?
# Definition of Requirement Analysis
Requirement Analysis is the process of identifying, documenting, and validating the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software system. It serves as a blueprint that ensures developers, designers, and business teams have a shared understanding of what the system should achieve.

# Importance in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)
Requirement Analysis is a critical phase in SDLC because it:

Defines Clear Objectives – Establishes what the system must do, reducing ambiguity.

Minimizes Errors Early – Identifies issues before development begins, preventing costly fixes later.

Enhances Communication – Acts as a bridge between stakeholders and developers, ensuring alignment.

Optimizes Time & Cost – Streamlines development by providing clarity, avoiding delays and budget overruns.

How It Ensures Project Success
Understanding Project Requirements

Helps translate user needs into technical specifications.

Ensures developers build features that match stakeholder expectations.

Minimizing Errors

Poorly defined requirements can lead to rework, which increases costs.

Requirement validation prevents issues from carrying over into later stages.

Successful Development Execution

Leads to structured project planning and efficient resource allocation.

Well-documented requirements allow seamless transitions between development phases.

Industry Example: Boeing’s Software Failure
Boeing’s 737 MAX faced severe software requirement misalignment, leading to tragic failures. The aircraft’s automated system had design flaws due to unclear requirements, which resulted in unexpected behavior. Lesson learned: Requirement Analysis could have flagged potential risks before development.
